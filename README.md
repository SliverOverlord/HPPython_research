# HPPython_reserch

This repository is intended to host research notes and code related to HPPython research and development.

Log files will be kept in the logs folder and code examples will be placed in the code folder.

From: Heecheon Park.

I suggest that we work on the log on the Google drive for now.

Reason being that I am not quite familiar with .md file.

Google office provides a multitudes of tools to emphasize the size and color of fonts and ability to

add pictures.

Sure, you can add pictures on .md file but first you have to upload the screenshot or image file to the repo

to apply the image to the .md file.
