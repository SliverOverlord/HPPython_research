Today we worked on implementing a split function and a print function within an mpi program to split a matrix, and send the two halves to
separate clients. 
The client machines will receive segments of the original matrix sent from the master via MPI_Send.
Using MPI_Recv the segments will be read into the client machine and printed using the programs printMatrix function. 
This will illustrate implementation of single program multiple data using mpi.
I encountered several errors involving the free() function.
