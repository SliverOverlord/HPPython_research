To do list

1. Benchmark: 
    Sequential (Python(numpy / numba), Java, C, Python(list), Python(list/numba))
    Parallel (mpi4py (numpy / numba), Java (OpenMPI), C (MPICH))
    
    We would like to compare the results of all the benchmarks including numpy's matmul function
    and that of openMPI and MPICH.

    Make 2 versions of matrix multiplication in C (1d and 2d)
    
    

2. Find disadvantages of using mpi4py, numpy, and numba. (Numpy array access makes program slow)
    It should be mentioned in the introduction of our paper.
    
3.
